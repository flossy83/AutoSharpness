### AutoSharpness
---

#### About

AutoSharpness is a plugin application for Enigma2-based PVRs which allows you to set different picture sharpness values according to the resolution of the video content.  It was created to try and make low resolution TV broadcasts more watchable.  Please note the quality of the picture sharpening is dependent on the video processor of your PVR.

#### System Requirements

AutoSharpness was written and tested on a Beyonwiz V2 PVR.  Theoretically it should also run on other PVRs which use the Enigma2 system.  The PVR must support video sharpness control via the system process path /proc/stb/vmpeg/0/pep_sharpness.

#### Installation

1. Download the .ipk file from the downloads section and copy it to a USB drive.

2. Insert the drive into the PVR and follow the on-screen instructions.  Otherwise, use the PVR's file explorer to manually run the .ipk file.

3. Restart the PVR.

The AutoSharpness plugin should then appear in the plugins menu, and also in the quick access menu (blue button on Beyonwiz).

#### Removal

Navigate to the plugin browser menu and select "remove plugins", then select the AutoSharpness plugin.
